<p>For the second assignment I decided to continue with my cooking theme. This is something that I enjoy
to do, and felt it was a good idea to share.</p>
<p>Here on this second assigment, I coded all the necessary functions, arrays and other parts of 
my story. I output the code to the console log as shown in week 1. </p>
